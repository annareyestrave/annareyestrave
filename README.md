- 👋 Hi, I’m @annareyestrave. With a scientific background and 7+ years of experience as a Business Intelligence Analyst and Consultant in Pharma and Public Healthcare, I’m now transitioning into a more data-focused role. I’m passionate about data analysis, visualization, and storytelling—and I’m determined to make them part of my day-to-day life.
- 👀 I’m interested in:
  - Purposeful businesses that aim to improve people’s lives—whether through health, wellbeing, sustainability, technology, or community.
  - Data storytelling, strategy, customer insights, and process optimization.  
  - Projects where data meets impact.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - How to tell better data stories and build intuitive dashboards.
  - How to take my SQL, Python, R, and Tableau skills further, especially through automation.
  - Still on my list: statistical methods for sales and marketing, A/B testing with Python, Power BI.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - Data-driven projects with real-world impact.  
  - Internships or junior roles where I can grow as a data professional.  
  - Anything where curiosity, collaboration, and purpose meet.
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annareyestrave/) or drop me a line at a.reyestrave@gmail.com  
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’ve lived in multiple countries, switched careers, and learned SQL and Python during toddler nap times and Bluey episodes—resilience is my superpower.
