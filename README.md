- 👋 Hi, I’m @annareyestrave. I'm an Associate Data Analyst. I recently transitioned into a more data-focused role after 7+ years working in the Pharma and Public Healthcare space. I’m currently building towards a full-stack analytics skillset, developing expertise in data analysis, data engineering, and data modeling to create meaningful, end-to-end insights.
- 👀 I’m interested in:
  - Purpose-driven projects that make a positive impact on people’s lives — whether through health, wellbeing, education, sustainability, technology, or community.
  - Data storytelling, communication, strategy, innovation, and process optimization.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - Advanced SQL, Python, and data modeling concepts.
  - Data engineering foundations — pipelines, ETL, and database design.
  - How to craft clear, intuitive, and actionable dashboards, and tell data stories that inspire decisions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - Data-driven projects with real-world impact.  
  - Opportunities that challenge me to grow as a data professional and build full-stack analytics skills.  
  - Anything where curiosity, collaboration, and purpose meet.
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annareyestrave/).
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’ve lived in multiple countries, switched careers, and learned SQL and Python during toddler nap times and Bluey episodes — resilience is my superpower.
